In the console, player sees a grid by 20x30 (row x column). In this grid, player’s character starts in 
the first cell, and certain amounts of trees and enemies are located in random cells. Each cell are 
hidden, that means player doesn’t see the enemies or trees. Player only see the cells that are next 
around the him/her or the cells that has been already passed by and make it visible (fog of war). Player 
can see the all of the grid with activating the cheat. Pressing c activate and deactivate the cheat. If the 
cheat is active all the cells in the grid will be visible, otherwise all of them will be hidden. Player can 
move in the grid with using w-a-s-d keys. If there is a tree or enemy appear in the path of the player, 
he/she can’t move to that direction. If the enemy is right next to the player, the player can kill the 
enemy with pressing h. If all the enemies are death or the player presses q game ends.
